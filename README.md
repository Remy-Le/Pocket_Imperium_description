# Pocket Imperium: Java-Based Board Game
Warning: The file names below may not be exactly their real file names. The names of the files in this README.md file are chosen for simplicity.

## Description
Pocket Imperium is a board game with cards and ships, developed as a class project for "LO02: Object-Oriented Programming." The goal is to score the highest points by invading hexes. This project aims to reproduce the board game entirely in Java, adhering to the game's rules. The game is playable in the terminal.

## Goal of This Project
The main objective of this project is to create a playable version of the Pocket Imperium board game in Java. The game must follow the rules of the original game and be playable in the terminal.

## How I Structured the Code
The project is organized into different Java classes, each handling specific functions:

- `Main.java`: The entry point of the application, responsible for initializing and starting the game.
- `Game.java`: Contains the core game logic, including rules and game state management.
- `InterfaceCommand.java`: Handles user input and commands, providing a terminal-based interface for the game.

Each class contains functions to manage game initialization, user interactions, and game logic.

## Usage Examples

## Technical Decisions
The project uses Java for its robust object-oriented programming features.

## Key Lessons from This Experience
Through this project, I learned the importance of:

- **First Project in Java**: Gaining hands-on experience with Java programming and understanding its object-oriented principles.
- **Making a Game is Fun**: Discovering the enjoyment and challenges of game development.
- **Working with a Teammate**: Collaborating effectively and communicating asynchronously to achieve project goals.
